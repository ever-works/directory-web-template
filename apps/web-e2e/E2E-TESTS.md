# E2E Test Coverage

Complete listing of all E2E tests added across 4 PRs.

**Total: 165 new test cases across 43 new spec files** (excluding
continual-improvement smoke specs listed below — those are tracked
separately and add ~307 additional tests across 48 spec files).

> Governed by [Spec 010 — End-to-End Test Coverage](../../docs/spec/010-e2e-test-coverage/spec.md).
> The [implementation plan](../../docs/spec/010-e2e-test-coverage/plan.md) and
> [task list](../../docs/spec/010-e2e-test-coverage/tasks.md) capture the
> backlog (plugin registry, analytics emission, payments smoke, maps render,
> newsletter validation, client notifications) plus engineering passes
> (resilience and speed). New specs must be added to this file when they
> land and the **Total** line updated.

## Continual-improvement additions (2026-04-30)

Smoke specs added by automated continual-improvement runs to fill
coverage gaps that did not warrant a dedicated PR. They use only
public selectors (roles / labels / `data-testid`) and accept multiple
valid states (e.g. `/sponsor` may redirect or 404 depending on env).

| `tests/public/legacy-routing.spec.ts`              | 5     | Legacy / nested catch-alls: `/categories/category/[...]`, `/tags/tag/[...]`, listing `/tags/[...tag]` no-5xx. |
| `tests/public/item-survey-public.spec.ts`          | 2     | Public `/items/[slug]/surveys/[surveySlug]` survey-response page no-5xx for unknown slugs. |

| `tests/public/admin-by-id-pages-protected.spec.ts` | 18    | Admin per-`[id]` and `/client/**` page routes (admin/clients/[id], admin/surveys/[slug]/edit/preview/responses, admin signin, client dashboard / profile / settings (+ profile/billing/location/portfolio/theme-colors / submissions/trash), client sponsorships, client submissions, client trash) — non-5xx contract for anonymous visitors. |
| `tests/api/item-votes-public.spec.ts`              | 2     | Public `GET /api/items/[slug]/votes` non-existent-slug contract — no-5xx + non-error JSON envelope. Closes the last public per-item GET surface that was implicit rather than explicit. |
| `tests/public/per-slug-public.spec.ts`             | 3     | Per-slug public detail pages with unknown slugs: `/comparisons/[slug]`, `/categories/[category]`, `/tags/[tag]` — exercises the `notFound()` / disabled-feature branch with a non-5xx contract. Complements the legacy `(listing)` versions in `legacy-routing.spec.ts`. |
| `tests/api/item-comment-rating-by-id.spec.ts`      | 2     | `/api/items/[slug]/comments/rating/[commentId]` GET + PATCH for a non-existent comment id — no-5xx contract. Closes the last `/api/items/[slug]/**` per-comment route that was not explicitly smoke-tested. |
| `tests/api/item-company-write.spec.ts`             | 2     | `POST` and `DELETE` `/api/items/[slug]/company` (admin-only company assign / unassign) — no-5xx contract for anonymous callers. The matching `GET` is already covered in `payment-protected.spec.ts`; this closes the per-item company-assignment write surface. |
| `tests/public/per-survey-public.spec.ts`           | 1     | Public per-survey detail page `/surveys/[slug]` with an unknown slug — exercises the `notFound()` / disabled-feature branch with the same non-5xx contract as the rest of the smoke layer. Closes the last public-survey page surface that was implicit rather than explicit (the listing page sits in `public/surveys.spec.ts`, dashboard owner flow in `public/dashboard-surveys-protected.spec.ts`, admin per-slug pages in `public/admin-by-id-pages-protected.spec.ts`, and the REST surface in `api/surveys.spec.ts`). |
| `tests/api/nextauth-discovery.spec.ts`             | 9     | NextAuth catch-all (`/api/auth/[...nextauth]`) public discovery surface: GET `providers`, `csrf`, `session`, `signin`, `signout`, `error`; plus POST `signout` (no CSRF), POST `callback/credentials` (empty body), and GET `callback/<unknown>` — no-5xx contract. Closes the last NextAuth-managed surface that was implicit rather than explicit (the custom `/api/auth/change-password` helper sits in `auth-change-password.spec.ts`). |
| `tests/public/seo-manifests.spec.ts`               | 4     | Public SEO / manifest surface generated by `app/{robots,sitemap,opengraph-image}.{ts,tsx}` and the static favicon: `/robots.txt` (with content sanity check), `/sitemap.xml` (XML sanity check), `/opengraph-image`, `/favicon.ico` — no-5xx contract. Closes the last public crawler-/preview-bot surface that was implicit rather than explicit. |
| `tests/api/client-item-restore.spec.ts`            | 1     | Auth-gated `POST /api/client/items/[id]/restore` (soft-delete restore action) — no-5xx contract for anonymous callers. The matching CRUD surface (`GET / PATCH / DELETE /api/client/items/[id]`) is already smoked via `client-protected.spec.ts`; this closes the last `/api/client/**` per-id surface that was implicit rather than explicit. |
| `tests/api/items-popularity-scores.spec.ts`        | 15    | Public `GET /api/items/popularity-scores` query-param surface — exercises the `parseInt` + `Math.min(value, 100)` clamp on `limit` (valid integers, `999` / `10000` clamp targets, empty string → default fallback, non-integer / negative / zero edge cases) and the `locale` default + unknown-locale fallback (`en`, `fr`, `zh`, an unknown locale, plus combined `limit` + `locale` queries). Complements the single happy-path entry already smoked in `discovery.spec.ts` so a regression in the route's parameter parsing surfaces as a failing case rather than a silent change in scoring output. No-5xx contract; payload shape is intentionally not asserted because the score breakdown varies with the active data repository / database state. |
| `tests/api/items-export-query.spec.ts`             | 10    | Public `GET /api/items/export` query-param surface — exercises the Zod-validated `format` enum (`'csv' \| 'xlsx'`) defined in `apps/web/lib/validations/item-import.ts#exportQuerySchema`: both valid values (`csv`, `xlsx`), the empty-string rejection (`format=`), the unknown-value rejection (`format=invalid`, `format=json`), the case-sensitivity check (`format=CSV` / `format=XLSX`), and the unknown-extra-key passthrough (`format=csv&unknown=value`). Complements the single happy-path entry already smoked in `discovery.spec.ts` so a regression in the schema, the default-on-omit fallback, the rate-limit short-circuit, or the `getExportEnabled()` feature-flag gate surfaces as a failing case rather than a silent change in export behaviour. No-5xx contract; payload shape and `Content-Type` are intentionally not asserted because the response is either a 403 / 4xx JSON envelope or a binary CSV / XLSX stream depending on whether the export feature flag is on for the active config repository. |

## Not Covered (Require External Services)

The following scenarios are intentionally excluded because they require external service integration, sandbox environments, or infrastructure that cannot be tested in a standard E2E setup:

- **Payment flows** — Stripe checkout modal, sponsorship checkout (need Stripe sandbox)
- **Email flows** — Password reset, email verification (need email infrastructure)
- **Geo Analytics** — `/api/admin/geo-analytics` (needs geo service API keys)
- **Map Status** — `/admin/settings/map-status` (needs map provider API keys)
- **CRM Integration** — Twenty CRM config/test connection (needs CRM instance)
- **Session expiry** — Mid-session redirect to sign-in (hard to simulate reliably)
