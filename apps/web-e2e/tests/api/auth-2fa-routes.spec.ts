/**
 * Contract coverage for the email two-factor endpoints added by spec 046
 * (EW-137 enable/disable, EW-138/EW-140 resend, EW-142 OAuth gate):
 *
 *   POST /api/auth/security/2fa/enable
 *   POST /api/auth/security/2fa/disable
 *   POST /api/auth/2fa/resend
 *
 * The e2e request context carries no session by default, so the invariant
 * these specs pin is the **authentication gate** on the two security
 * routes and the **enumeration-resistant** shape of the resend route:
 *
 *   - `enable` / `disable` answer 401 `{ success: false, error: … }` for an
 *     unauthenticated caller, before any tenant lookup or profile write.
 *     Their OAuth refusal (403 + `code: 'OAUTH_ACCOUNT'`) sits *behind*
 *     that gate and is exercised through the UI in
 *     `tests/auth/two-factor-login.spec.ts`.
 *   - `resend` is deliberately session-free (there is no session mid-login)
 *     and re-checks the account password instead. It answers 400 for a
 *     malformed body and 200 for a well-formed one whatever the account
 *     state, so the body cannot be used to probe which addresses exist.
 *     429 is the only other distinguishable answer, once the 3-per-10-minutes
 *     budget is spent.
 *
 * The 404-tolerance in the "route exists" assertions keeps this spec honest
 * on a deployment that has not shipped spec 046 yet, in the same spirit as
 * the other skip-on-absence probes in this suite.
