# Feature spec — `046-admin-billing-issues`

## 1. Summary

An admin can see every payment problem the site knows about in one place —
`/admin/billing-issues` — and act on it: mark it resolved or dismissed, or issue
a refund through whichever payment provider took the money.

## 2. Motivation

The template already collects everything needed to spot a billing problem: the
`subscriptions` table records `failed_payment_count`, `status`, `payment_provider`
and the provider invoice id, and every payment provider adapter already implements
`refundPayment(paymentId, amount?)`. None of it was reachable. A failed renewal
sent the customer an email and then vanished, and the refund seam had **zero
callers** — an operator's only recourse was the provider's own dashboard, one
provider at a time, with no record on the site.

Jira: [EW-116](https://evertech.atlassian.net/browse/EW-116).

## 3. Goals

- One admin queue for failed payments, disputes, refund requests, and
  subscriptions stuck in a bad state.
- Refund from that queue through the provider named on the payment record.
- Mark an issue resolved or dismissed, with a note and the acting admin recorded.
- Populate the queue from the payment records the site already stores, and from
  the failed-payment webhook, without a separate ingestion service.

## 4. Non-Goals

- A new payment abstraction. Money state stays on `subscriptions`; this feature
  adds triage state only.
- Provider-side reconciliation or a scheduled poller.
- Customer-facing refund requests. Only an admin can open or close an issue in
  this slice.
- LemonSqueezy refunds, which its adapter cannot perform (dashboard-only).

## 5. User Stories

As an admin, I want to see payment problems in one queue so that a failed charge
does not sit unnoticed.

As an admin, I want to refund a customer without leaving the site so that the
refund and the reason for it are recorded together.

As an admin, I want to mark an issue resolved with a note so that the next admin
knows what already happened.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC-1: a "Billing Issues" entry exists in the admin dashboard grid and in the
      admin profile menu, pointing at `/admin/billing-issues`.
- [x] AC-2: the page lists issues with status, type, provider, amount, customer
      and the reason the issue was raised, filterable by status, type and provider
      and searchable by customer, payment or subscription.
- [x] AC-3: an admin can issue a full or partial refund from a row, executed
      through the provider on the underlying payment record.
- [x] AC-4: an admin can mark an issue `in_review`, `resolved` or `dismissed`,
      with an optional note; the acting admin and timestamp are stored.
- [x] AC-5: a refund is only recorded on the issue after the provider call
      succeeds; a refunded issue can never be moved to another status; and two
      concurrent refund requests for one issue can never both reach the provider.
- [x] AC-6: the queue is populated from the stored payment records on demand
      (idempotently) and from the failed-payment webhook as it arrives.
- [x] AC-7: every route is admin-gated; the refund route additionally requires a
      resolved session so the acting admin id can be stamped.
- [x] AC-8: refunds and closures are written to the subscription history and the
      activity log.

## 7. Out-of-Scope Considerations

Disputes are modelled (`type = 'dispute'`) but Stripe's `charge.dispute.*` events
are not yet mapped in `stripe-event-map.ts`; a dispute issue can be raised
manually or by the re-scan today. Mapping those events is a follow-up to this
spec, not a new one.

## 8. UX Notes

The page reuses the admin shell exactly as `/admin/reports` does: `Container`,
`AdminStatusTabs`, `AdminFilterPopover`, `AdminActiveFilters`, `AdminSearchBar`,
`useAdminFilters` and `UniversalPagination`. Row actions open one dialog carrying
both the status control and the refund control, so the admin never has to guess
which button moves money. The refund button is two-step: the first click reveals
a confirm button labelled with the exact amount.

All copy is `next-intl` under `admin.ADMIN_BILLING_ISSUES_PAGE`, present in all
21 locale files.

## 9. Data & API Surface

New table `billing_issues` (migrations `0040_admin_billing_issues.sql` and
`0041_billing_issue_refund_claim.sql`; the claim column ships as its own migration
because a migration that has been applied is immutable): references
`users` and (nullably) `subscriptions`, with `type`, `status`, `payment_provider`,
`provider_payment_id`, `amount`, `currency`, `detection_reason`, `source_key`,
`refund_claimed_at`, `refund_id`, `refund_amount`, `refunded_at`,
`resolution_note`, `resolved_by`, `resolved_at`, `tenant_id`. A unique index on
`(tenant_id, source_key)` makes detection idempotent.

| Route | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/admin/billing-issues` | GET | Filtered, paginated list |
| `/api/admin/billing-issues` | POST | `{action:'sync'}` re-scan, or create one manually |
| `/api/admin/billing-issues/stats` | GET | Counts by status/type/provider + amount at risk, per currency |
| `/api/admin/billing-issues/{id}` | GET | One issue with its payment context |
| `/api/admin/billing-issues/{id}` | PATCH | Set status + resolution note |
| `/api/admin/billing-issues/{id}/refund` | POST | Refund via the record's provider |

`PATCH` deliberately rejects `status: 'refunded'`: only a successful provider call
may set it, so the row can never claim a refund that did not happen.

**Currency units — the sharpest edge in this feature.** Three representations meet
here and only one of them is obvious:

| Where | Unit | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subscriptions.amount` / `amount_paid` / `amount_due` | **major** (dollars) | The webhook writer stores `convertCentsToDecimal(...)`, and the customer-facing `subscription-card.tsx` formats them with `formatCurrencyAmount` |
| `billing_issues.amount` / `refund_amount`, the API body, the UI | **minor** (cents) | So a partial refund can carry cents at all |
| `PaymentProviderInterface.refundPayment(id, amount)` | **minor ÷ 100, for every currency** | Every adapter does its own hard-coded `Math.round(amount * 100)` and returns `amount / 100` |

So intake converts major → minor when seeding an issue from a subscription, and
the refund divides by 100 at the provider call and multiplies back on the way out.

The third row is the counter-intuitive one and is worth stating plainly: the
provider seam is **not** currency-aware, because the adapters' factor is a literal
`100` rather than the currency's own. Making this conversion currency-aware — the
natural-looking fix — would pass ¥1000 through unchanged, the adapter would
multiply by 100, and the customer would receive ¥100,000. Currency-aware
conversion (`currencyMinorUnitFactor`) is therefore used for storage and display
only; standardising the adapter interface on minor units is the real fix and
belongs in the payment-provider spec.

Storage and display go through the template's shared `formatCurrency` /
`formatCurrencyAmount`, which already handle the zero-decimal currencies.

**Concurrency.** A refund is claimed before it is attempted. `refund_claimed_at`
(migration `0041`) is set by a single conditional UPDATE that exactly one request
can win, so two admins pressing "Refund" at the same moment cannot both reach the
provider. The timestamp doubles as an ownership token: the request that finalises
the refund must still match the claim it took, so a request whose claim expired
and was taken over cannot write its outcome over the request that now owns the
issue.

A provider error deliberately does **not** release the claim. A thrown error does
not say whether the money moved — a lost response, a proxy timeout and a clean
rejection are indistinguishable from here — so releasing would let an immediate
retry submit a second refund for a charge that may already be refunded. The claim
is left to expire after `REFUND_CLAIM_TTL_MS`, which bounds the cost to a short
wait instead of a duplicate payout, and the 502 says so.

For the same reason the status-change path passes `skipIfRefunded`, which carries
the "not already refunded" condition into the UPDATE's own `WHERE` — a status read
taken before the write cannot bind a row a concurrent refund has since changed.

**An unreadable request is never guessed at.** Both writing POST routes read the
RAW body and treat only a genuinely empty one as "omitted"; malformed JSON, or
JSON that is not an object, is a 400. The emptiness test deliberately does not
trim first, because trimming collapses a whitespace-only body — the shape a
truncated or mis-serialised payload arrives in — onto "no body supplied". On
`.../refund` that would turn a typo in a partial-amount payload into a full,
irreversible refund; on `POST /billing-issues` it would run the re-scan, which
writes rows.

Pagination is equally strict on both list routes. `validatePaginationParams` (the
repo's shared validator) parses with `parseInt`, so `limit=3.5` reads as 3 and the
caller gets 200 with a page size it never asked for; `lib/utils/integer-query-param.ts`
rejects any value that is not a whole-integer token before the shared validator
applies the repo's range rules.

**Refund target.** `POST .../refund` accepts an optional `providerPaymentId` that
overrides the reference stored on the issue and is persisted when the refund
succeeds. Detection can only fill that column from what the site stores
(`subscriptions.invoice_id`), and Stripe's `refunds.create` takes a payment intent
rather than an invoice id, so the dialog exposes the reference as an editable
field and an admin holding the real charge id from the provider dashboard can
supply it instead of hitting a dead end. The failed-payment webhook prefers the
invoice's `payment_intent` when Stripe expanded one.

## 10. Plugin / Adapter Impact

None. The refund resolves its provider through the existing
`getOrCreateProvider(name)` factory, so any provider added to that factory later
becomes refundable here with no further change.

## 11. Risks & Open Questions

- A provider refund that succeeds while the follow-up row update fails would leave
  the issue open against a refunded payment. The provider call is therefore last
  before the write, and the write is a single statement.
- LemonSqueezy answers 409 with an instruction rather than attempting a refund.
- Webhook intake is best-effort by design: a failure there must not make the relay
  retry an already-fulfilled payment, and the re-scan recovers the row anyway.

## 12. Acceptance Test Plan

Playwright specs `apps/web-e2e/tests/admin/billing-issues.spec.ts` (admin sees the
page and its controls; client and anonymous are gated) and
`apps/web-e2e/tests/api/admin-billing-issues-query.spec.ts` (the full query
surface cannot bypass the gate; the refund route rejects anonymous callers, bad
amounts and unknown issues before any provider call). Both new routes are added to
the admin route and API coverage matrices.
