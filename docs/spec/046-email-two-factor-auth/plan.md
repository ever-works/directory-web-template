# Implementation Plan — `046-email-two-factor-auth`

> **Spec:** [`spec.md`](./spec.md)

## 1. High-Level Approach

Split the feature in two halves so the security-critical arithmetic is testable
without a database:

- `apps/web/lib/auth/two-factor-code.ts` — **pure**: code generation, hashing,
  constant-time digest comparison, expiry and lockout arithmetic. No `db`, no
  mail, no `next/headers` imports, so it can be imported directly by a test file
  without spinning up an app. It uses `node:crypto`, so it is Node-runtime code,
  as every caller already is.
- `apps/web/lib/auth/two-factor.ts` — **stateful**: reads and writes
  `twoFactorCodes` and the `client_profiles` 2FA columns, and dispatches the
  email.

The sign-in flow then gets a second leg. Two call sites verify, deliberately:

1. `signInAction` (server action) pre-checks so the user gets a *specific*,
   translatable message. NextAuth collapses everything `authorize` throws into a
   generic `CredentialsSignin`, which is why the existing password check is also
   duplicated there. This leg verifies with `consume: false`.
2. `authorize` in `lib/auth/credentials.ts` is the **authoritative** gate — it is
   the only place a session is minted, so a scripted
   `signIn('credentials', …)` that skips the server action still has to satisfy
   it. This leg consumes the code.

## 4. Data Model

```
twoFactorCodes
  id          text pk
  userId      text -> users.id  on delete cascade   (indexed)
  email       text
  code_hash   text      -- hex HMAC-SHA256 under a server key; NEVER the code
  expires     timestamp                              (indexed)
  attempts    integer default 0
  consumed_at timestamp
  created_at  timestamp default now()
  tenant_id   text -> tenant.id on delete cascade    (indexed)

client_profiles
  two_factor_enabled          boolean  (pre-existing, now written)
  two_factor_failed_attempts  integer default 0
  two_factor_locked_until     timestamp
```

Rotate-on-issue: minting a code deletes every earlier code for that user, so at
most one is live and the newest email is always the valid one — the same shape
`verificationTokens` and `passwordResetTokens` already use. Issuing also sweeps
rows that expired more than a day ago so the table cannot grow without bound.

## 5. Security Decisions

- **Hash-only storage, and the hash is KEYED.** `code_hash` is a hex
  HMAC-SHA256 under `TWO_FACTOR_CODE_SECRET` (falling back to `AUTH_SECRET`).
  A bare digest would not do: the code space is 10^6, so a rainbow table of
  every six-digit SHA-256 fits in a few megabytes and anyone with read access to
  the table could recover live codes. The key lives in the environment, not the
  database, so a dump alone yields nothing. A slow KDF would also close it but
  would put a deliberate cost on a sign-in hot path for a secret that already
  expires in ten minutes and tolerates only five guesses. Comparison is
  `crypto.timingSafeEqual` over the two digests, never `===`.
- **Where the budget lives.** The enforcement counter is on `client_profiles`,
  not on the code row, precisely so that requesting a resend cannot clear it.
- **No oracle while locked.** An active lockout short-circuits before the code
  table is touched, so a locked account leaks nothing about whether a code
  exists.
- **Malformed input is free.** A value that is not six digits cannot match a
  digest, so it does not spend an attempt — otherwise a clumsy user could lock
  themselves out with typos.
- **Enumeration.** `POST /api/auth/2fa/resend` answers `200` for every
  well-formed request regardless of whether the address exists, the password is
  right, or 2FA is on. The only distinguishable answer is `429`.
- **The resend route re-checks the password** because there is no session at that
  point in the flow; without it, anyone who knows an address could use the
  endpoint to bomb that inbox.
- **Issuance is capped inside `issueTwoFactorCode`** (6 per 10 minutes per
  account), not only at the routes. `authorize` is reachable by posting straight
  to `/api/auth/callback/credentials`, which bypasses the server action's own
  per-email limiter; putting the cap at the single choke point every issuance
  path shares closes that hole. On the sign-in paths, exceeding it answers
  `AuthErrorCode.RATE_LIMITED` and mints nothing; the resend route keeps its
  generic `200`. The count comes from the **database** (rows in the window), not
  from the in-memory `ratelimit()` map, because a process-local counter would
  let a multi-instance deployment issue `6 × instances` codes per window. That
  is why issuing marks earlier codes consumed rather than deleting them — a
  deleted row cannot be counted.
- **The password budget is reserved, not checked-then-charged.** The sign-in
  action calls `ratelimit()` up front for every submission (an atomic map
  read-and-write with no `await` inside) and hands the slot back with
  `refundRateLimit()` once a code-carrying submission's password has proven
  correct. A check-then-act pair around the password verification would let
  concurrent requests all observe "slots remaining", which is exactly how a
  second factor turns into extra password guesses.

## 6. Alternatives Considered

- **Redis for attempt tracking** (as the ticket suggests). Rejected: the template
  has no Redis dependency and adding one for this would be a deployment
  requirement for every generated directory. The database is already shared
  across pods, which is the property that actually matters.
- **A separate `/auth/verify` page** for the code step. Rejected: it would need
  to carry the password across a navigation. Keeping the step inside the existing
  form keeps the credentials in component state and out of any URL or cookie.
- **Storing a "2FA pending" marker in the JWT.** Rejected: it would mean issuing
  a token before the second factor passed. Nothing is minted until `authorize`
  returns.
- **bcrypt (or another slow KDF) for the code hash.** Rejected in favour of a
  keyed HMAC: it closes the same rainbow-table hole, but costs a KDF round on a
  login hot path for a secret that already expires in ten minutes and tolerates
  only five guesses. A *bare* SHA-256 was rejected outright — 10^6 candidates is
  not a search.
- **Requiring a verified email address before 2FA may be enabled.** Rejected for
  now: `client_profiles.email_verified` defaults to `false` and the sign-up flow
  never flips it, so the guard would refuse essentially every account on a
  default deployment. The lockout risk it addresses is instead handled by
  refusing to enable when no mail provider is configured at all (`503`
  `EMAIL_NOT_CONFIGURED`) — the case where a code could *never* arrive — plus
  the documented operator unlock. Recorded as Q-046b.

## 7. Constitution Check

| Article | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| I — Plugin-first | Not applicable: this extends the core auth flow, which the constitution keeps outside packages. No plugin boundary is crossed. |
| II — TypeScript only | Pass. All new files are `.ts` / `.tsx`. |
| III — Public-surface stability | Pass. `sendTwoFactorTokenEmail`'s third argument is optional, so the previous two-argument call keeps working. `canEnableTwoFactor` / `authMethod` / `accountLockedUntil` are additive fields on the settings response, and the client types them optional. |
| IV — Latest stable frameworks | Pass. No dependency added or moved. |
| V — Performance budget | Pass. The card is a client component on an already-client settings page; the sign-in step adds no bundle beyond one input. The settings route adds two indexed queries. |
| VI — Reuse before build | Pass. Reuses `lib/mail`, `ratelimit()`, `logActivity`, the `hasPassword` detection from the connected-accounts route, and the `expires`-column pattern from `passwordResetTokens`. |
| VII — Test coverage | Pass. Unit coverage for the pure half, Playwright coverage for the flow and the routes. |
| VIII — No removal without migration | Pass. Purely additive; the pre-existing read-only 2FA badge keeps working and now reflects a value users can change. |
| IX — Documentation | Pass. This trio, [`docs/authentication/two-factor-auth.md`](../../authentication/two-factor-auth.md), a `docs/log.md` line and Q-046a. |
| X — Modular packages | Pass. Two focused modules, ~200 and ~170 lines. |

## 8. Rollout & Rollback

The migration is additive and idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`,
`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`), so it can be applied ahead of the code and re-run
safely. No existing row changes meaning: `two_factor_enabled` stays `false`
everywhere until a user opts in, and every sign-in path for a user who has not
opted in is byte-identical to before.

Rollback is to revert the application code; the added table and columns are inert
without it. Operators who need to unlock an account by hand can clear
`two_factor_failed_attempts` / `two_factor_locked_until`, or set
`two_factor_enabled = false`.
